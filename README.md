#This project revolved around doing an analysis around Honolulu, HI. Specifically using Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate. I will be using SQLAlchemy, ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

-Part 1 will analyze and explore the climate data. Part 2 will design a climate app for the climate data.

-Conclusion: I was able to create 3 API Static Routes (precipitation, station, tobs) and 2 API Dynamic Routes (start, start/end) that return the jsonified data of all the stations as well as the min, max, and average temperatures calculated from the given start date to the end of the dataset.
